# twitter-project
This project is for an assignment I'm doing with TTS (Tech Talent South) Full Immersion Foundational Java Course. With this assignment, I will be creating a twitter-esque project with Spring Boot. It will have some dependencies: DevTools, H2, JPA, Lombok, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, Validation, and Spring Web.
